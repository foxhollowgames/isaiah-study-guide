LDS_CHAPTER_NOTES='''
Moses 2 places human creation within God's work. Human dignity shapes how we treat others.
Moses 3 connects the garden with God's commands. Study work, rest, and partnership together.
Moses 4 expands the garden account. Second Nephi 2 connects the Fall with choice and redemption.
Moses 5 adds gospel teaching after the Fall. Compare Cain's choices with Adam and Eve's worship.
Moses 6–7 expands Enoch's account. Zion means a people united in righteousness and care.
Moses 8 describes Noah's preaching before the flood. Read preparation alongside the call to repent.
The Church manual reads Noah's deliverance within God's dealings with humanity. Consider faithful action under warning.
Noah worships after deliverance. Consider how gratitude can follow a period of waiting.
A covenant is a sacred agreement. God's sign joins a promise with duties toward life.
The family record joins many peoples to common ancestors. Consider the duties that shared humanity creates.
The Church manual contrasts Babel with the covenant family story. Consider how pride differs from trust.
Abraham 2 links the covenant with blessing all families. Study the promise as a duty to serve.
Abraham gives Lot the first choice. Consider how covenant living can support peace over advantage.
Alma 13 expands Melchizedek's role as a priest. Keep that teaching distinct from Genesis's brief account.
God's promise meets Abraham's fear about an heir. Consider how faith can coexist with unanswered questions.
God sees Hagar in distress. Consider whose need you can recognize within unequal relationships.
Abraham 2 links covenant blessings with the gospel. Study both the promised blessing and its responsibility.
Abraham pleads for other people's lives. Consider how prayer can express care beyond your household.
Lot's escape includes grief and later family harm. Deliverance does not remove the need for moral care.
Abraham's fear puts Sarah at risk. Consider the effects of choices made to protect yourself.
God hears Hagar and Ishmael. Family conflict must not erase another person's need.

Abraham secures a burial place for Sarah. Consider how covenant hope can accompany mourning.
Rebekah agrees to the journey. Consider the place of willingness within family and covenant choices.
The birthright concerns a lasting family responsibility. Consider what you value beyond an immediate need.
God renews the promise to Isaac. Consider how patient action can reduce a dispute.
Jacob receives a blessing through deception. A promised purpose does not make every family choice harmless.
God meets Jacob while he travels away from home. Consider your response to God's promised presence.
God sees Leah's pain. Consider how unequal affection can affect people within a family.
The children's names reveal hope and distress. Consider each mother's experience rather than only the family totals.
Jacob and Laban set a boundary. Consider how clear agreements can help end harmful disputes.
Jacob receives the name Israel after a struggle. Consider how dependence on God can accompany fear.
Esau welcomes Jacob. Consider what reconciliation requires after years of injury.
Dinah suffers violence and her brothers take revenge. Consider how to protect people without adding further harm.

Esau's descendants have their own place in Genesis. Consider how to read neighbors without dismissing them.
Joseph loses home through his brothers' choices. Consider the damage caused by favoritism and envy.
Judah admits that Tamar has a stronger claim. Consider whether your judgment uses unequal standards.
Joseph refuses sexual wrongdoing and suffers false accusation. Consider integrity when it brings no immediate reward.
Joseph serves others while he waits in prison. Consider how service can continue during uncertainty.
Joseph prepares for famine after explaining the dreams. Consider how knowledge can become practical care.
The brothers begin to acknowledge their earlier harm. Consider the place of truthful memory in repentance.

Joseph speaks truth about the sale while preserving the family. Consider forgiveness without denial of harm.
God reassures Jacob before the move to Egypt. Consider how covenant trust can accompany a difficult change.

Jacob blesses both sons and gives Ephraim the leading place. Consider duties as well as inherited blessing.
Jacob's words join blessing with consequences. Consider how family choices can affect later generations.
Second Nephi 3 adds a prophecy attributed to Joseph. Keep that Restoration account distinct from Genesis 50.
