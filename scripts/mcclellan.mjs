    summary: 'McClellan says the servant is Israel. He links the servant’s pain with exile. He says an old Aramaic Bible does not show a dying Messiah before the time of Jesus. The books he cites do not rule out every earlier idea.',
    limitations: 'This video is about Isaiah 49 and 53. It gives McClellan’s view of history. It is not Church teaching. Experts still debate who the servant is. Missing proof does not prove that an idea never existed.',

    summary: 'Second Isaiah is a name for Isaiah 40–55. McClellan thinks these chapters came from a later time. Chapter 39 warns of exile. Chapter 40 speaks as if exile has begun. He also finds new words and a new style.',
    limitations: 'This is one expert view. The video does not review all the proof. A new chapter does not prove that a new person wrote it. The words we checked did not name another study.',

    author: 'Dan McClellan', year: 'May 3, 2024', type: 'Scholar video',
    url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL9N-pF5pcU',
    summary: 'McClellan compares two old Hebrew copies of Isaiah 53. Many changes are only spelling. Some changes affect the words or their meaning. One copy has the word “light” in verse 11. The text was kept well, but it did change.',
    limitations: 'We did not check the video’s number totals. One chapter cannot show how much the whole Bible changed. The date of a copy is not the date when the book was first written.',

    summary: 'Isaiah 28:10 repeats short sounds. McClellan says they copy speech that people cannot understand. Verses 11–13 warn that the people will not understand. This is not the same as a lesson about learning one step at a time.',
    limitations: 'This is one way to read hard Hebrew words. A faith lesson can use the words in another way. The part we checked did not name another study.',

    url: 'https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/glory-of-israel-9780567460929/',
    summary: 'Studies how the Isaiah Targum developed across the first through fourth centuries CE. A Targum is an Aramaic translation that also interprets the text. McClellan cites Chilton at 3:31 when discussing stages of interpretation around 70–135 CE. The useful distinction is between a text’s surviving form and earlier traditions within it.',
    limitations: 'Publisher description and the excerpt read in the video were reviewed, not the complete book. The proposed dates describe layers of interpretation. They do not date every sentence. The linked edition’s date differs from the 1982 original cited in the video.',
    reviewed: 'Publisher record checked. Video excerpt supplies the specific dating discussion.',

    summary: 'Examines whether a messianic interpretation of the suffering servant existed before Christianity. In the conclusion read at 5:10–6:55, Page rejects claims of uniform interpretation. He also rejects ruling out earlier possibilities. He considers a developed expectation of a Messiah who atones through suffering unlikely, while allowing preparatory ideas. This qualification matters when assessing McClellan’s stronger opening wording.',
    limitations: 'Cambridge’s record, extract, and references were accessible. The conclusion was reviewed through McClellan’s reading, not a complete independent reading of the article. This 1985 study does not represent every subsequent argument.',
    reviewed: 'Bibliography checked with Cambridge. Conclusion summary is explicitly indirect, through the cited video.',

    url: 'https://www.eerdmans.com/9780802808455/the-suffering-servant/',
    summary: 'Collects studies of Isaiah 53 in Jewish and Christian interpretation. McClellan introduces this volume at 7:47. His selected passage discusses the Targum’s victorious Messiah and cautions against assuming that its changes were directed against Christianity. The collection provides a route to broader study of the passage’s interpretation.',

    url: 'https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/28155/1/Servant_and_Servants_in_TJ_Isaiah_WUNT_.pdf',
    summary: 'Tooman compares the traditional Hebrew text with the Isaiah Targum. The Targum presents a victorious Messiah who protects those who suffer. Its servants are the righteous who obey Torah, God’s instruction. They can include outsiders who join the covenant. This changes how the servant and the community relate. McClellan cites the chapter at 9:17.',
    limitations: 'The university repository provides an accessible manuscript. Its pagination can differ from the published chapter. The argument concerns this Targum’s interpretation, not every Jewish reading of Isaiah. The university dates publication to 2021, despite the video’s approximate recollection of its age.',

    summary: 'Presents transcriptions of biblical manuscripts from Qumran and records differences between texts. McClellan introduces it at 1:07 in his Great Isaiah Scroll video. A critical apparatus is the set of notes that identifies these differences. It helps readers check which manuscript supports a reading instead of relying on a general claim of accuracy.',
    limitations: 'Publisher description and McClellan’s explanation were reviewed, not the complete edition. The local guide does not reproduce its transcriptions or apparatus. The video’s letter counts remain attributed to McClellan.',
    reviewed: 'Bibliography and scope checked with the publisher. Passage-level discussion comes from the video.',
