# Initial pilot validation — September 20, 2026

This section records the original build history. It does not define the current scope. The current guide covers Isaiah 1–66 and gives no default priority to chapters 36–39.

The delivered pilot contains Isaiah 36–39 (90 WEB verses), 27 selected word studies, 24 source records, eight passage settings, and three guided explorations.

## Automated checks

- `npm run check`: local data integrity, citation URL syntax, cross-references, verse numbering, word occurrences, coordinates, and required assets.
- `node --check dist/app.js`: JavaScript syntax.
- `scripts/prepare-words.py`: checks the stated Hebrew headword against the local OSHB text for every eligible verse containing the English selection. This caught and removed an incorrect association of Isaiah 37:31 with the noun used in 37:4 and 37:32. This check establishes presence in the verse, not an exhaustive token alignment or expert review.

## Browser checks

Checked the local app at desktop size and a 390 × 844 phone viewport:

- Chapter and passage controls, independent reading/map layouts, Historical/LDS switching.
- Timeline keyboard scrubbing to 539 BCE retains the selected chapter; Return to passage restores its contextual date.
- Campaign cards can be pinned, expanded, closed, and opened by keyboard; related passages update the reader.
- Word studies replace scripture in the map sidebar; Back restores the selected word and scroll position, including a word deep in a chapter.
- Mobile reading word studies appear in a visible bottom panel.
- Guided exploration advances the passage and map location.
- Historical source library contains 20 records; the LDS layer includes four additional Church sources.
- Terrain and illustration assets load locally; no browser console errors were observed in the checked flows.

Pointer-hover previews are implemented with a short delay and a wider route hit area. Browser checks exercised the corresponding focus and pinned-card paths; a separate physical mouse-hover test was not recorded.

## Come, Follow Me source update · September 27, 2026

Read and checked the five official 2026 Isaiah lesson pages (38–42). Added five Church source records with original summaries, chapter coverage, links, and limitations. Pilot-era cross-chapter prompts were removed after full-book coverage was complete. Each lesson now stays with its stated chapter range.

`npm run check` passes with 90 verses, 29 sources, 8 passages, and 27 curated word studies. Syntax checks pass for the source module and content generator. A focused check confirms five additions, classification as LDS sources under the existing library filter, preservation of the word studies, and no duplicate changes when the update is applied again. No browser interaction was rerun for this content-only update; the earlier browser counts above describe the original pilot.

## Boundaries

This is a study guide, not a complete Isaiah commentary. Political overlays and routes are schematic; terrain is a modern elevation reference. The app identifies uncurated words rather than inventing language alignments. Citation integrity checks do not guarantee continued availability of external websites. Research summaries and interpretive notes have not undergone independent specialist review.
# Map readability update

- Routes use faction colors and screen-sized arrowheads following the stored point order. The legend lists factions present in the enabled layers at the selected date.
- Place labels prioritize the active passage, nearby historical events (within six years), then other places in the chapter while following its date. Secondary labels become eligible at zoom 7 and require progressively less clearance as the map zooms in.
- Label placement reserves space for city dots, other names, and map controls, and updates after chapter/date changes, zooming, panning, resizing, and opening or closing the layer and feature panels.
- Browser verified warm terrain, route arrows, secondary labels, and Libnah gaining priority in Isaiah 37; no browser errors reported. Local syntax and content checks pass.

## Language revision · September 27, 2026

Simplified interface messages, passage summaries, historical notes, guide steps, source explanations, word studies, and related Come, Follow Me questions. Updated the content generators and rebuilt the published content. Added `WRITING-GUIDE.md` for future edits. Scripture text, source titles, and Hebrew and Greek forms were not edited.

The content check passes with 90 verses, 29 sources, eight passages, and 27 word studies. JavaScript syntax checks pass for the app and content modules. The word-study generator passes its Hebrew checks.

Browser checks confirmed the revised Remnant study in Map and Read views, the message for a word without a study note, the return to passage notes, and the revised LDS study question. This was a focused copy verification, not a repeat of the full browser test suite.

The revision applies plain-English principles from ASD-STE100. It does not establish full compliance with the standard’s dictionary and writing rules.



## Full Isaiah expansion — September 27, 2026

- Cached publisher HTML for all 66 chapters. The parser checks each chapter against its expected verse count and sequential numbering: 1,292 verses total.
- Content checks pass for 122 sources, 70 passage notes, 50 word studies, six guides, citation IDs, places, and local assets. Every verse has exactly one passage note.
- All 50 selected Hebrew studies pass lemma checks against the local Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible. The 23 new entries do not claim Greek equivalents.
- Map transition checks and JavaScript syntax checks pass.
- Browser checks confirm chapters 1, 35, 36, 39, 40, and 66 render the expected verse counts. Chapter 1 disables Previous. Chapter 66 disables Next. Dated chapters retain their labels. Undated chapters show a separate map reference date.
- The new Worship and justice guide opens at Isaiah 1:17 with the verse and LDS reflection. Chapter selection and the Comfort word study work at a 390-pixel viewport without horizontal page overflow.
- Research remains selected. New chapter summaries explain the biblical text, not a completed independent historical review. The existing map timeline remains 780–539 BCE.

## Chapter map focus — September 28, 2026 UTC

- All 66 chapters have validated focus locations and source references. The map contains 74 places.
- Route checks cover the northern approach, Egypt connections, the southern western-campaign section, Lachish–Jerusalem, Lachish–Libnah, the embassy, and departure from Babylon.
- Automated checks pass for route indices, camera coordinates, rebuild stability, interrupted transitions, and reduced motion. All earlier content checks pass.
- Browser navigation passed for all 66 chapters. Desktop and 390-pixel phone views showed the chapter 36 route endpoints. No browser errors were reported.
- The camera reserves space for map controls. The focus button restores the chapter view after manual movement. Paths obey the layer toggle.
- Geographic choices remain editorial. Representative locations and schematic connections do not establish exact ancient roads or resolve disputed site identifications.

## Wider narrative maps — September 28, 2026 UTC

- Chapter selection and Focus Isaiah show the full chapter view. The redundant Big picture and Local detail buttons have been removed.
- All 66 chapters have narrative notes. The data contains 81 places, nine approximate geographic areas, and 39 narrative path records across 19 chapters with mapped movements.
- Isaiah 15 has eight distress markers and four flight connections. The text’s unnamed attacker remains unnamed. Branches do not claim distinct refugee groups or confirmed starting towns.
- Tests cover movement kinds, scripture references, geographic areas, Moab’s missing military itinerary, the full chapter 36 campaign, local detail, future exile, visionary connections, and suppression of unrelated inherited campaigns.
- All automated checks pass. Browser checks passed for all 66 narratives and default overview selection. The Moab route list opened its reference and uncertainty card. Overview and detail controls worked in the 390-pixel phone layout. No application browser errors were reported.


## Chapter source dialogs — September 29, 2026

- All five `npm run check` suites pass. The new chapter-source suite checks stable citation numbers, local footnote targets, image previews, perspective filters, interview links in all 66 chapters, and the sample's chapter limits.
- `node --check dist/app.js` and `git diff --check` pass.
- Browser check: an Isaiah 36 footnote opens the Lachish relief photo, source summary, credit, and limits inside the app.
- Browser check: Escape closes the source dialog and restores focus to the chapter footnote. The chapter and verse URL remain unchanged.
- Browser check: the Hopkin interview footnote opens its summary, review note, and limits inside the chapter.
- Public sources retain the review scope recorded in each source. The added UI does not imply that the full harmony or every interview recording was reviewed.


All-chapter study enrichment: automated checks render every chapter in Historical and LDS mode (132 combinations). Checks confirm exact scripture quotations, explanation coverage, quote attribution, source inventory completeness, lesson scope, conference chapter filters, Cyrus image scope, and whole-word place matches. Existing chapter, map, citation, and navigation checks remain required. Public source quotations were checked against their linked text; unquoted source notes remain paraphrases with their existing review limits.


## Remove generic harmony commentary — September 29, 2026

The repeated Madsen and Hopkin reading-help section and its chapter citations were removed. This replaces the interview-link behavior recorded above. The publisher record, sample, and interviews remain in the source library. The content generator no longer adds generic harmony notes or references to chapters.

All six `npm run check` suites pass. The chapter-source checks confirm that all 66 chapters exclude these general resources from chapter evidence. The 132 chapter and mode renders still pass. `node --check dist/app.js` passes.


## Specific interview insights — September 30, 2026

Added source-based notes for Isaiah 1, 2, 6, and 30 in LDS mode. These replace the blanket removal above with selected, useful material. Reviewed the public Madsen and Hopkin transcripts, Madsen’s poetry example, and the official Isaiah 2 and 2 Nephi 12 texts. Short quotations retain attribution. study guide applications are labeled separately. The full book and recordings were not reviewed.

All six check suites pass. Automated checks cover the selected chapter citations and all 132 chapter and mode renders. They confirm that the new notes are absent from unrelated chapters and Historical mode. The old generic reading-help section remains absent. JavaScript syntax checks pass.

## Ancient roads layer — October 2, 2026

- Added 14 sourced Iron Age travel corridors across the southern Levant, inland Syria, Assyria, and Babylonia. Ten use the stronger evidence style. Four use a dashed probable-corridor style.
- The Ancient roads layer is off by default. Its saved setting survives reloads. Roads stay below chapter Paths and do not receive direction arrows.
- Each road supports pointer and keyboard selection. Its card gives a description and links to Dorsey and Aharoni as applicable. The shared footer provides the map disclaimer.
- Added schema checks for road IDs, confidence levels, coordinates, required explanations, and source references.
- `npm run check`, JavaScript syntax checks, and `git diff --check` pass. Browser checks covered desktop and 390 × 844 layouts, toggle on/off, keyboard selection, the source card, saved state, and console warnings or errors. No console warnings or errors were present.

### Road and layer corrections

- Roads now use a thin, light parchment line (`#e1d6b8`). They remain less prominent than chapter Paths.
- A selected road keeps the same color. It becomes thicker and more opaque. Pointer and keyboard focus do not add a blue road style.
- The Nations control now independently shows or hides historical nation regions. The Areas control continues to manage chapter-specific areas.
- Road cards use the shared footer disclaimer. They do not add a separate map-limit panel.
- Regression checks protect the shared-disclaimer rule, the Nations layer boundary, and the road selection style.
- Expanded coverage includes the Damascus–Aleppo inland corridor, the Aleppo–Euphrates approach, the Assyrian King’s Road to Nineveh, the Tigris route through the Assyrian capitals, and the route through Arbela toward Babylonia. The added records cite academic historical geography and Oracc’s Assyrian Empire Builders project.
- Release assets and data now use one version token. If a browser temporarily combines cached HTML with a newer script, startup recreates the missing layer-options container instead of leaving the map blank.

## Closer terrain zoom

- Raised the manual zoom limit from 10 to 14.
- Added 7,580 offline terrain tiles (466.2 MB). The Levant detail area reaches native zoom 12. Jerusalem, Lachish, and Samaria reach native zoom 14.
- `npm run check` passed, including complete tile coverage, PNG headers, geographic bounds, and named-place coverage. Pillow also decoded all 7,580 new tiles.
- Browser checks reached the maximum zoom with level-14 tiles loaded and no console errors. Panning beyond the close-up area showed the broader terrain without empty areas. The chapter focus control still returned to the overview.
- River and shoreline geometry remains at its previous resolution. Terrain outside the close-up areas is enlarged at zoom levels 13 and 14.

## Complete added-book context

Run `python scripts/build-native-books.py` after editing `scripts/book-context-complete/*.json`.
Run `npm run check:bible` after the build.
Run `npm run check` before publishing shared-reader changes.

The complete context check requires one authored row, explanation, and selected exact Scripture verse per ready chapter.
It checks all 731 added chapters in Historical and LDS perspectives.
It compares generated explanations with their persistent source rows.
It also checks artifact assets, rights metadata, image chapter scope, source-dialog display, and short guide selections.

Review contextual accuracy against the actual selected passages and their surroundings.
Check difficult cases for speaker attribution, violence, disputed identities, and comparison objects from different places or periods.
Use browser checks to verify representative reading views, source dialogs, guides, and loaded photographs.
Automated coverage and sentence checks do not establish historical truth or full STE100 compliance.

Both checks passed locally before publication through the existing GitHub Pages workflow.
