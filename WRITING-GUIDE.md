# Isaiah Study Guide writing guide

Use plain English based on ASD-STE100 principles for app labels, instructions, messages, and original study notes. Use familiar words for a general reader. Explain necessary terms without reducing the passage's depth. This is a project writing guide, not a claim of full STE100 compliance.

## Write for the reader

- Give one instruction per sentence. Name the control the reader must select.
- Use short sentences. Aim for at most 12 words in instructions and 15 words in explanations.
- Use words that most third-grade readers know. Explain needed Bible, history, map, Hebrew, and Greek terms.
- Do not remove a needed fact only to lower the reading level.
- Rewrite the idea. Do not use a list of automatic word swaps.
- Put one main idea in each sentence. Prefer 5–12 words when that length preserves the complete idea.
- Prefer a person or thing as the subject. Follow it with a clear action.
- Break a long explanation into several short sentences.
- Keep source titles, names, quotations, Hebrew, and Greek exact. Do not count these items as reader copy.
- Use active voice when it makes the actor clear.
- Use the same term for the same item. Match control names exactly.
- Prefer concrete words. Explain necessary historical, religious, Hebrew, and Greek terms in context.
- Replace abstract metaphors such as “contextual anchor” with a direct explanation: “The map uses 703 BCE to show the setting.”
- State what the app knows and what remains uncertain. Simplification must not increase a claim’s certainty.
- Distinguish the biblical account, historical evidence, Church teaching, and original study questions. Keep each claim attached to its sources.
- An empty state must describe what is missing. Do not say information is loading unless loading is actually in progress.
- Explain the passage before describing the work done to build the guide.
- Remove sentences that repeat the title, nearby text, or another note.
- Keep general source-review limits in Source details. Show a limit in the reading only when it changes that passage's meaning.
- Do not repeat atlas descriptions, publication records, or general source summaries under every chapter.
- Use a specific study question. Do not add a repeated “Original study reflection” label. The “LDS lens” section heading is the only perspective label.
- Describe what people do and why it matters. Keep image instructions and research-process notes out of their profiles.

## Write each chapter in three parts

Isaiah 1 is the model. Read the whole chapter in the local World English Bible before writing.

**Summary: what happens.** Use four to eight short sentences.

- Name the speaker or the form first: a vision, a song, a letter, a prayer, a court case.
- Follow the chapter's order. Include the turn where the subject or mood changes.
- Name the people the text names. Write “the fatherless and the widow,” not “people in need.”
- State each condition and each result. Do not shorten a choice into “God gives them hope.”
- Include facts that the map, a photograph, or a later note depends on.
- Do not explain meaning here. Keep the reasons for the note.

**Note beside the selected verse: why.** Use four to seven connected sentences.

- Start with the problem or question the selected verse answers.
- Give the reason from the chapter itself. Cite verse numbers so the reader can check.
- Connect the verse with one other verse that explains it, such as a cause, a contrast, or a result.
- End with what the key word or action means in this passage. Do not end with a general moral.
- Use only what the text says. A claim about ancient law, custom, or history needs a reviewed source.
- Do not repeat a summary sentence.

**Study question.** Use one or two sentences.

- State the conflict, person, or promise from the chapter. Then ask the question.
- Point to verse numbers when they help the reader look.
- Do not ask a question that fits any chapter, such as “How can worship help you?”

The **LDS lens** heading starts the Latter-day Saint section of a chapter. The study question, Church sources, and interview notes belong below it. Keep the historical reading above it.

Check each new sentence against the verse it describes. A simple word must not change who acts, what they do, or how certain the result is.

Isaiah's summaries and questions live in `scripts/full-isaiah.mjs`. Its verse notes live in `scripts/chapter-enrichment.mjs`. For added books, summaries and questions live in `scripts/book-copy-chapters/<book-id>.json`. Their verse notes live in `scripts/book-context-complete/<book-id>.json`. Use `node scripts/show-chapter.mjs <book-id> <first> <last>` to read chapters. Use `node scripts/apply-chapter-copy.mjs <book-id> <batch-file>` to apply a batch. The apply script rejects long sentences and banned terms before it writes. In an added book's LDS lens, keep the sentence that names a Church source. Then add the passage question.

## Write reference notes

Reference notes are the profiles, place notes, word notes, source notes, and map notes. Hold them to the chapter standard.

**Cut what the reader already knows.**

- Do not tell the reader to read the verse. Cut “The passage determines the sense.”
- Do not list what a note leaves out. Cut “No house, road, or border is shown.”
- Do not describe the work behind the guide in a profile, place note, or word note.
- Do not end a note with a general lesson.
- A short true note is better than a padded one. “Honey.” is too thin. “A sweet food from bees or fruit syrup” needs a source.

**Profile.** Read every passage the profile lists before writing.

- `role` is a label with no full stop. Name the office or the act the reader will meet.
- `relations` names family and the named people this person deals with. Use one or two sentences.
- `meaning` says what the person does in this book, in order. Then say what changes because of it. Use two to four sentences.
- Write the act, not a description of the act. Write “He tells the officials what Baruch read.” Do not write “His report extends the message's audience.”
- Keep people with the same name apart. Keep a doubt that the text leaves open.

**Place note.** `summary` says what happens at the place in this book. Name the people and the chapter. `limits` states the real doubt about the location in one or two sentences. Keep a named site proposal. Do not add one.

**Word note.** Give the plain meaning first. Add a second sentence only for a real second use, with the kind of passage where it occurs.

**Source note.** `summary` says what the source contains for this book. `limits` says what the source cannot support and what was not read. Keep every fact about review scope, dates, names, and disagreement. Simple words must not turn “not reviewed” into “reviewed.”

**Map note.** Say what the points and lines show. State the one doubt that affects this chapter.

For added books, reference notes live in `scripts/book-copy-reference/<book-id>.json`. Keys are `people.<id>.role`, `people.<id>.relations`, `people.<id>.meaning`, `places.<id>.summary`, `places.<id>.limits`, `sources.<id>.summary`, `sources.<id>.limits`, `chapters.<n>.mapNote`, and `chapters.<n>.routeEvidence`. Use `chapters.*.mapNote` for every chapter. Use `node scripts/show-reference.mjs <book-id>` to read the current notes. Use `node scripts/lint-reference-copy.mjs <book-id>` to check the file. Isaiah's reference notes live in the generator files named below and in `dist/portraits.js`.

## Preserve source text

Preserve scripture quotations, source titles, proper names, Hebrew and Greek text, and attribution. Simplify the study guide’s surrounding explanations. Do not present a paraphrase as a quotation.

Use “dictionary form” to explain the base form of a word. Explain that a word’s form and meaning can change in a passage. Do not imply that every English word has an exact Hebrew or Greek match.

## Maintain and check

For each Bible book, summaries describe what happens. Meaning notes explain why specific actions matter. Do not repeat the summary.

Tie each study question to the selected chapter. Name the person, action, promise, or conflict. Keep Church lesson attribution beside its actual teaching. Add a separate, passage-specific question. Do not attribute an original question to the lesson.

Identify the speaker when describing a disputed claim. Keep uncertainty that changes the passage's meaning. Put general review limits in Source details.

Save book edits in source files or rebuild overlays before rebuilding reader data. Preserve scripture, source links, people links, map data, and publication status. Run `npm run check:bible` and the relevant book checks. Read the changed passages after rebuilding. Run `npm run check` and `node --check dist/app.js` when shared reader files change.

Use Isaiah's existing information layout when adding books. Fix shared book builders rather than editing generated reader files alone.

Do not place an AI illustration label or appearance disclaimer beneath each portrait. Keep the shared artwork note in the footer. Keep descriptive image alt text, original art metadata, and licensed artwork credits with their license links.

Show only map controls supported by the book's data. State when a chapter has no mapped places. Keep specific location limits in Map context. Do not present chapter order as a historical date.

Use each book's publisher code and chapter filename format for scripture quotations. A shared whole-book scripture source must remain available in every chapter.

Display structured source-review records as readable dates and scope notes. Do not show object placeholders such as `[object Object]`. Run `npm run check:bible` after rebuilding to check these presentation rules across all available books.

Interface copy lives in `dist/index.html` and `dist/app.js`. Study content comes from `scripts/create-content.mjs`, `scripts/full-isaiah.mjs`, `scripts/come-follow-me.mjs`, and `scripts/prepare-words.py`. Update the source files, then rebuild `dist/data/content.json`. Run the content generator before the word-study generator, because the content generator starts with an empty word list.

Run `npm run check` and `node --check dist/app.js`. Check changed messages in both Map and Read views where applicable. These checks validate app data and behavior; they do not establish STE100 compliance.

Before claiming full compliance, review vocabulary, approved meanings, parts of speech, technical terms, and all applicable writing rules against the official standard. Short sentences alone are insufficient.

## Show source content in place

Simple language must preserve depth. Short sentences do not require short explanations. Build connected paragraphs that explain causes, customs, power, or literary choices. A plot summary alone is not a study note. Avoid ending every paragraph with a general lesson about trust, care, or leadership.

Use Isaiah as the reference for evidence within the reading. Choose an exact verse that supports the explanation. Explain how that verse connects with the surrounding passage or the book's larger concerns. For poetry, attend to speakers, images, form, and changes in voice. For law, explain the practical situation and whose interests the rule protects.

Use artifact photographs where they clarify a specific passage. Identify the object, date, location, collection, and image rights. Explain the relevant practice beside the photograph. State when an object is only a regional or period comparison. Do not imply that an Egyptian harp belonged to David or that a Babylonian tablet records Jeremiah's purchase. Do not add unrelated objects merely to fill a page.

Keep original close readings distinct from museum descriptions and attributed scholarship. A museum link supports facts about its object. It does not make the museum the author of our biblical interpretation. Keep Church readings in their existing section.

Every ready chapter requires an original contextual explanation and one meaningful exact Scripture selection. Read the selected passage and its surroundings before writing. Use three to six connected sentences when the explanation needs them. Longer explanations can use separate paragraphs on separate topics. Choose the verse for its role in the argument. Do not choose the first verse or midpoint automatically.

Added-book context lives in `scripts/book-context-complete/<book-id>.json`. Each row contains the chapter, selected verse, heading, explanation, and optional artifact source IDs. The builder rejects missing or duplicate chapters. `scripts/book_context.py` adds source and image metadata. Museum image identity and rights live in `scripts/study-objects.json`. The shared builder carries the explanations into chapter introductions, event details, and short curated guides.

The chapter meaning field uses the contextual explanation. Keep the opening plot summary within eight short sentences. Do not append an earlier generic moral to the new explanation. Guides select a small route through the book. Complete chapter coverage belongs in the chapter reader, not an oversized guided tour.

An original close reading can use the local World English Bible as its primary text. This does not verify dates, authorship, archaeology, or scholarly consensus. Additional claims need their own reviewed sources. Record the distinction in the review metadata. Do not label original interpretation as a museum's or scholar's conclusion.

Separate image scope from a source's general chapter associations. Added-book `imageChapters` names the chapters that actually need the photograph. A broadly useful source must not spread one photograph through unrelated passages. Keep an image's explanation and specific limits beside it.

Before release, require one contextual note and selected verse per ready chapter. Check exact quotations, unique coverage, source IDs, image assets, rights, and both perspectives. Review notes for speaker attribution, unsupported claims, repeated morals, and confusion between people with the same name. Read representative difficult passages in the app. Automated sentence checks do not replace editorial review.

Put evidence and its limits in the main explanation for each study item. Use a compact link list for sources in map cards, word notes, and guides. Do not repeat source summaries or source-detail buttons in these lists. Do not add date or context labels to the start of a paragraph when the card already shows that information. Keep images needed for guide questions beside those questions. Preserve image credits and license links. Source details and the source library retain full source metadata. Store Isaiah's shared image metadata in `scripts/source-previews.mjs`. Store added-book museum records in `scripts/study-objects.json`.

Maintain short added-book guide routes in `GUIDE_CHAPTERS` within `scripts/book_context.py`. Choose passages that expose the book's larger concerns. The complete JSON chapter files remain the only source for their contextual prose. Refresh the release version in the shared builder and native book loader when publishing reader changes.


Add relevant object images and verified short quotations beside the main explanation. Include image credits and quotation attribution, edition, page or section, and a direct source link. Explain what the evidence supports and what it does not establish. Distinguish the photographed object from other copies or editions. Keep the final source list compact.
